# Jet-Engine-Sim
A complex physics based jet engine simulator

IMPORTANT!!!!!
how to use?
Until I put all the code n' stuff a godot program thinggie you need to use python to run the sim.  As for how to run the sim, use the python file with the biggest verion number, dont forget to change the csv file directories. (Im not going to do that for you you lazy shits, fuck you Magey!)
